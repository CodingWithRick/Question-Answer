        <h2>2. What is the goal of the game?</h2>
        <h3>
          Ans - The player has to control the paddle using the left and right
          arrow keys and prevent the ball from falling and destroy all the
          bricks using that ball.

        <h2>3. Write a brief story of your game?</h2>
        <h3>
          Ans - Every time during winter, Harris's locality holds many
          competitions. Of these, balancing a ball on a bat is Harris's
          favorite. During this pandemic, since the neighborhood could not hold
          any competition, Harris is extremely disappointed. So his mother asked
          me to create a game for him that could be played at home and could
          bring back the smile on Harris's face. So I created this game Brick
          Breaker where Harris has to balance the ball on the paddle. He can
          move the paddle using the left and right arrow keys to save the ball
          and break the bricks. He has three lives in all within which he has to
          break all the bricks. As soon as the ball touches any brick, it will
          turn into a fireball and increase the score. If the ball falls, then
          Harris's life will be deducted. If Harris manages to break all the
          bricks within the three lives, he wins or else he loses.

        <h2>4. Which are the playing characters of this game?</h2>
        <h3>
          Ans - This is a single player game and the playing character is the
          paddle. This paddle is controlled by the users using the left and
          right arrow keys.

      <div class="jus">
        <h2>5. Which are the Non Playing Characters of this game?</h2>
        <h3>
          Ans - The NPC or Non Playing Characters are the bricks and the ball.
          The ball has friction and bounces off the paddle and all the edges
          except the bottom edge. The bricks are static in position and have
          random colors. As soon as the ball touches the bricks, they are
          destroyed and the score increases by 5.
